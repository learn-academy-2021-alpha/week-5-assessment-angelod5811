## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.
- RESTful routes - A RESTful route is a route that provides mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful route depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.
- JSON - JSON is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types.
- Validations - Validations are used to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database
- Strong params - Strong Parameters is a feature of Rails that prevents assigning request parameters to objects unless they have been explicitly permitted. It has its own DSL (Domain Specific Language, or in other words, a predefined syntax it understands), that allows you to indicate what parameters should be allowed.
